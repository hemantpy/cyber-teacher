## What is CyberGuard?

CyberGuard is a **next-generation cybersecurity education platform** that transforms complex network security concepts into visual, interactive experiences. Instead of reading textbooks, you **simulate real attacks and defenses** in a safe, sandboxed environment.

> Perfect for students, educators, and security professionals looking to understand attack vectors and defense mechanisms.

## Features

### Interactive Simulation Engine
- **Real-time packet visualization** — Watch data flow through your network
- **Dynamic entity states** — See servers, firewalls, and devices respond to events
- **Smooth 60 FPS animations** — Powered by GSAP for buttery-smooth visuals

### Attack Simulation
| Attack Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **DDoS Flood** | Overwhelm servers with traffic |
| **SQL Injection** | Database exploitation attacks |
| **Man-in-the-Middle** | Intercept network communications |
| **Phishing** | Social engineering simulations |
| **Malware** | Malicious payload deployment |
| **Ransomware** | Encryption-based attacks |

### Defense Mechanisms
| Defense Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Web Firewall (WAF)** | Filter malicious requests |
| **IP Blocking** | Blacklist suspicious sources |
| **Rate Limiting** | Throttle excessive requests |
| **DNS Filtering** | Block malicious domains |
| **Quarantine** | Isolate compromised systems |
| **Backup Restore** | Recover from attacks |

### Guided Lessons
- **Step-by-step tutorials** — Learn attack/defense workflows
- **Interactive quizzes** — Test your knowledge
- **Progress tracking** — Track your learning journey
- **AI Explanations** — Get context-aware guidance

### Sandbox Mode
- **Free experimentation** — No restrictions, pure learning
- **Custom network topologies** — Build your own networks
- **Real-time health monitoring** — Watch system health change
